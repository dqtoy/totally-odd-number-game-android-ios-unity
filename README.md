Mobile Number Puzzle Game Unity C#
Playfab

This game was developed for a local boardgame developer. I saw the project from conception to live operation. Written in Unity and C#. The consists of more than 100 levels, multiple game modes, a complex AI opponent engine, more than 30 in-game unlockable cosmetics, online leaderboards, a referal system, daily challenges, in-app purchases with receipt validation and much more.

The game utilises Microsoft's Playfab to implement a cloud-based game server. Server-side logic is written in Javascript and mainy consists referals, currency regeration, time-based rewards etc.

Playfab also acts as a key-value store which is used to store player data, inventory, statistics and other game data. This store is queiered from the client-side and all responses are in the form of JSON elements.
